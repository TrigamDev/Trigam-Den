You'll be fine as long as your intention wasn't to spam, so don't be too scared by this rule.\n\n> \"Spamming\" includes rapidly sending messages, copy+pasting messages repeatedly, sending massive text walls, sending copypasta, sending the same message in multiple channels, etc. However, this isn't a comprehensive list, and you can be banned for things not included in this list. Use your best judgement."
